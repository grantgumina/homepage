				Hey I'm Grant. Right now I work at <a href="http://bettercloud.com">BetterCloud</a> where I'm Head of Product. Previously, I've worked at Upbound where I led Product as the company scaled from 20 to 100 people. I've also worked at Qumulo where I helped build their cloud business, and Microsoft on the OneNote team. I was also CTO and Co-Founder of PipelineHero (shutdown). When I'm not geeking out about distributed systems or bringing products to market, I've been known to dawn a super suit and race bikes with <a href="http://apexracing.org/">Apex Racing</a> in Seattle, WA.
