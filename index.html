				Hey I'm Grant. I'm a 0 to 1 Product Leader who loves building really technical products and leading world-class Product Management and Design teams which consistently exceed customer expectations. I've worked in distributed storage, Cloud Native Infrastructure as Code, Open Source developer tooling, and more recently no-code automation. I've operated in both public, VC, and Private Equity environments launching new and reimaging existing products in each. When I'm not geeking out about distributed systems or bringing products to market, I've been known to dawn a super suit and race bikes with <a href="http://apexracing.org/">Apex Racing</a> in Seattle, WA.
